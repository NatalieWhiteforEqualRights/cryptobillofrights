The Crypto Bill of Rights

<1>Freedom from persecution
<p>
Crypto currency should be treated proportionally to every currency known to man without being subjugated to oppression, victimization, maltreatment, mistreatment, abuse discrimination, or tyranny. Crypto holders and people who work in the crypto world should be able to live and work without punishment or harassment based on their currency of choice.
  </p>

<2>Freedom from unreasonable search and seizure
<p>
The right of individuals to secure their livelihood and their crypto, crypto-assets, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated. No warrants shall be issued, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or crypto to be seized.
  </p>
  
<3>Freedom from overreach
<p>
Excessive laws and government overreach shall not be made against crypto currency, its holders, or companies involved in the crypto world. The same laws and taxation that apply to all other currencies should not exceed the laws and taxation applied to crypto currency
  </p>
<4>Freedom from discrimination
<p>
Because crypto currency is the great equalizer, crypto currency businesses should not discriminate in their rules and policies against crypto currency holders based on race, gender, religion, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, ethnic background, location of residence, or citizenship status.
  </p>
<5>Duty of Responsability 
<p>
We understand that with great wealth comes great responsibility and we will strive to use that wealth for the advancement of human kind, offering equal access to wealth and other resources. We strive to implement both immediate and lasting change for generations to come. 
  </p>
<6>Right to Records. 
<p>
In the event a crypto currency business is required to disclose information to tax authorities you it should properly inform their customers of it. The business should provide clientele with the tools necessary to properly calculate the information require for them to easily comply with tax requirements. 
  </p>
<7>Right to Privacy
<p>
Information will only be given over to authorities by specific court order and will not give over information in a broad spectrum.
  </p>
<8>Responsibility of self- governance 
<p>
It is our belief that industries with strong self-governance are less likely to be the subject of excessive government over regulation and enforcement action. As a result we believe it is imperative that the crypto currency industry actively monitor itself and expose bad actors within its own boundaries to promote a safe, fair, and just environment for the crypto community.
  </p>
<9>Expansion Amendment<p>
  
The enumeration of crypto's proposed bill of rights allows for the expansion, elaboration and adaption necessary to best fit the current needs of the community it aims to serve.
